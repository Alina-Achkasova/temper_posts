# Project Title

Sortable Post List

## Description

There's an overview of posts on the left side which is being loaded from an external API. The user is able to change order of the posts by clicking on the up/down arrow. After that's done, an action which describes which post was moved where appears on the right side (list of actions committed). The user can can click on the “Time Travel” button on one of the action cards, which rewinds the order of the posts as it was before that action was taken. This action should also remove the clicked action card and the action cards above that.
